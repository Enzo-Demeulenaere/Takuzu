# Takuzu 
A Takuzu game implementation in Pharo.

This game in mainly inspired by '0h h1', a puzzle game you can discover here: https://0hh1.com

Also this game is used to present two nice features: 

 - Application Packaging and Installer
 - Using native MacOS Menus.

# How to install

To install the core of the game and the unit tests:
```
Metacello new
    baseline:'Takuzu';
    repository: 'github://tesonep/Takuzu/src';
    onUpgradeUseLoaded;
    onConflictUseLoaded;
    load: 'core'"
```

# How to play 

## Rules 

Takuzu is a japanese puzzle game also known as binary sudoku.

The goal is to fill the grid with red or blue cells following these 3 rules :

	- You can't have more than 2 cells of the same color aligned.
	- The must be as many red and blue cells on each row and column
	- Rows and Columns must be all different one to another

## Launch a game

After loading the project, you can execute `Takuzu openWithMenuBar` and a window will appear.

You can start playing with the 'Levels' menu, with non-ambiguous levels from size 4x4 to 12x12 with 5 levels per size.

# Application Packaging

This example generates installation packages for Windows and MacOS. 
You can check the releases in this repository as they are generated by actions.

You can also play on 4x4 and 6x6 randomly generated levels in the 'Random' menu.
The random generation is a bit messy so you may encounter ambiguous levels, improvements might appear in the future.
			
Have fun !
